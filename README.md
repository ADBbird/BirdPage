The extension should run as-is. To modify the set of images shown, replace data.csv with a csv file containing a single column of numerical image IDs from https://www.macaulaylibrary.org/. Filtered searches can be made at https://search.macaulaylibrary.org/catalog and a .csv containing metadata for up to 10,000 images matching the search can be downloaded at any one time, and this file can be modified in any csv editing program to produce a correctly formatted data.csv file (the image IDs are in the first column). The initial default contains all 5-star rated photographs as of 24/02/2026. To build with a new data.csv, run convert.py to generate a new script file, and replace the original script.js file with this in the extension

Note that the image embedding service the Macaulay Library provides that this extension uses is only available for non-commercial uses.
